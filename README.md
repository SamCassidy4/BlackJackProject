# BlackJack Project

# Description

This project was designed to simulate a game of Black Jack, where the goal of the game is to reach the score of 21.The user is prompted to "Hit" or "Stand" against the delear's cards, the closest person to get to 21 wins the game. If the player goes over 21 the dealer wins. If dealer goes over 21 the player wins.
	 This project was designed to outline the importance of well encapsulated data as well as the always important object oriented concepts. The Black Jack project was designed to outline the importance of class creation along with method organization. This project required me to use all of my object oriented knowledge taught to me, some of the key concepts I had to keep well track of was inheritance, and encapsulation. Other than that, the trickiest part of this assignment was keeping track of all the methods created and what each does. Labeling was also important in this assignment. I found myself having obscure labeling when at the time of generation made sense. The well encapsulation of my project comes from keeping the players hand private to where if other players were added the card data would be kept private from others. This would allow for an increased player count in the future if needed. Inheritance was also important because it held the blackjack hands. However, the Hand class did more than just offer a blueprint for the blackjack app. The hand class is also transferable to any other card game that would be made in the future. Furthermore, the "cards" package is also available to be used in a future project simulating card games.

# What I learned

I learned the importance of proper method labeling. I found myself not being able to remember methods correctly when it came to the implementation due to the vagueness. Upon completion of this project I also learned the importance of proper encapsulation not for the actual act of the program running but for legibility sake. Having code that is well encapsulated strengthens the idea of how programs work compared to real life. In this case, having a player hand of cards public for others to see does not make very much sense when it comes how black jack is played in real life. Furthermore, I learned how powerful object oriented programming actually is. This assignment solidified that idea in me. To be able to create classes an objects of pretty much anything you can think of is such a powerful tool. Anything can be considered data in OO and this helped me realize that idea. Lastly, what I learned is I need to slow down when it comes to the creation of my programs. Taking the assignment one line at a time rather than viewing the program as a whole increased my comprehension as a developer. Having a template to follow along to like the UML diagram provided helped me flesh out more of my ideas and keep me focused on the task at hand rather than worrying about what else needed to be done in the project. I will be using more idea creation from here on out to help me structure my code.
